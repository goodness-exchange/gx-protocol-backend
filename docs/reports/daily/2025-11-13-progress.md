## Work in Progress

### 1. 🔵 Risk Assessment Document
**Status:** Planned for Day 2
**Priority:** Medium

Will document:
- Technical risks (integration, performance, security)
- Operational risks (deployment, scaling, monitoring)
- Business risks (timeline, resources, scope)
- Mitigation strategies for each risk

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

### 2. 🔵 Architecture Validation
**Status:** Planned for Day 2
**Priority:** High

Will review:
- Fabric network configuration
- CQRS pattern alignment with chaincode
- Database schema validation
- Network topology (devnet, testnet, mainnet)

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

## Blockers & Challenges

### No Current Blockers ✅

All planned work for Day 1 completed successfully without blockers.

**Potential Future Blockers:**
1. Fabric network access verification needed (Day 2)
2. TLS certificate extraction from Kubernetes (Phase 2)
3. Identity enrollment with partner-api role (Phase 2)

# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the GX Coin Protocol backend system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: What forces are at play
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder

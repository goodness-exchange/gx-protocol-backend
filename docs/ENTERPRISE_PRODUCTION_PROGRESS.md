## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK (Needs Immediate Attention)

1. **Zero Test Coverage (Phase 3)**
   - Impact: Cannot verify production readiness
   - Mitigation: Start writing tests ASAP in parallel with Phase 2
   - Owner: QA Team / Developers

2. **Missing Admin Authorization (Phase 2)**
   - Impact: Security vulnerability, anyone can call admin endpoints
   - Mitigation: Implement admin middleware in Phase 2 (priority #1)
   - Owner: Security Team / Backend Team

3. **Incomplete Business Logic (Phase 2)**
   - Impact: svc-tax returns $0 fees, breaks revenue model
   - Mitigation: Complete fee calculation in Phase 2
   - Owner: Backend Team

### MEDIUM RISK

4. **No Monitoring Stack (Phase 4)**
   - Impact: No production visibility, blind to issues
   - Mitigation: Deploy Prometheus + Grafana early
   - Owner: DevOps Team

5. **Missing Event Schemas (Phase 2)**
   - Impact: Projector cannot validate events, data integrity risk
   - Mitigation: Create schemas in Phase 2 (priority #2)
   - Owner: Backend Team

### LOW RISK

6. **Missing OpenAPI Specs (Phase 5)**
   - Impact: No input validation, poor API docs
   - Mitigation: Can defer to Phase 5, manual validation exists
   - Owner: API Team
